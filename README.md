In this project my task was to predict 6 different targets. Each of them is binary classification. However, most of the labels were missing. So, in order to correctly train my learners, I divided this task into 6. Each of the tasks handling according target. I preprocessed X data by imputing most frequent one for object data-typed columns (one hot encoded these since they canâ€™t be given as learner algorithm inputs) and mean for numerical columns. I also dropped columns that have more than 40% missing data because it has no validity if more than 40% is missing. In order to acquire my labels, I used non-missing labels to train Random Forest and K-NN learners and used LogisticRegression to Ensemble (Each target has separate learners from all these three types). After training this system, I noticed that for both precision and AUROC Random Forest was the most successful algorithm for this task. So, I used Random Forest to predict test results. Below are my training process results tested with 20% of training data that I did not use for training. The data cannot be uploaded to Git Hub since the file is too large. I worked with over 120,000 data points each consisting 200 attributes.
